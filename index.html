    <h1>Transit Inequity in NYC & the Bay Area</h1>
    <p>Visualizing access gaps and service disparities across income and geography</p>
  </header>
 
  <main>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Public transportation is often championed as a cornerstone of equitable urban life, providing affordable access to employment, education, health care, and social networks. In theory, robust transit infrastructure funded by federal investment should serve all residents equitably. However, in practice, access to public transit, especially reliable and frequent service, remains profoundly uneven. This project investigates spatial inequities in access to federally funded transit in two of the most transit-reliant metropolitan regions in the United States: New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. Using a combination of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, American Comunity Survey (ACS) census demographics, and spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS Pro, this study visualizes and interprets the geographic distribution of transit frequency, coverage, and its alignment with household income.</p>

    <h2>Research Questions and Literature Context</h2>
      <p>My research was guided by one core question: do lower-income communities in these cities receive the same level of access to frequent and reliable federally funded transit services as wealthier communities? To answer this question, the analysis drew from and builds upon transportation equity literature that critiques the limitations of stop proximity as a sole measure of accessibility. Manaugh and El-Geneidy (2012), for example, emphasize that transit frequency is a crucial determinant of effective mobility, one that is often unequally distributed across income and racial lines. Similarly, Karner and Niemeier (2013) argue for the integration of social equity into transportation planning metrics, insisting that service provision must account for demographic disparities, not just geographic coverage.</p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>In my analysis, I focused on federally funded local modes of transportation, including New York’s MTA Subway, MTA Bus, NYDOT’s Staten Island Ferry, and the Bay Area’s BART, Muni (bus and rail), AC Transit, SamTrans, VTA, Golden Gate Ferry, and San Francisco Bay Ferry. Using GTFS data, I parsed through weekday schedules, trips, and stop times to calculate average wait times at each transit stop. Any stop with an average headway greater than 20 minutes was classified as low-frequency. These stops were then spatially joined to census tracts to calculate the total number of low-frequency stops per tract.</p>
      <p>In parallel, a no-transit-access zone layer was created by buffering each bus and rail stop by 0.5 miles, and each ferry stop by 0.75 miles, reflecting commonly used planning standards for walkable access. Areas not intersected by any of these buffers were dissolved into polygons and mapped as red diamond symbols, visually emphasizing spatial exclusion from the entire transit network.</p>
      <p>Lastly, demographic data from the most recent year of the American Community Survey was layered onto the maps using a five-class gradient of median household income: under $50,000, $50,000–$85,000, $85,000–$125,000, $125,000–$200,000, and over $200,000. Each class was assigned a color along a yellow-to-blue sequential ramp, providing an immediate visual link between income and transit conditions.</p>

Each class was assigned a color along a yellow-to-blue sequential ramp, providing an immediate visual link between income and transit conditions.</p>
    
    <h2>Map Interpretation and Findings</h2>
      <p>The resulting dashboard reveals several striking patterns. In the Bay Area, low-frequency stops cluster along the East Bay corridor, especially in Richmond and San Leandro. These communities not only have large low-to-moderate income populations but are also historically underserved by high-frequency transit options. Some areas, like Bayview, show service gaps despite recent gentrification, suggesting a complex interplay between income and transit investment. In New York City, the Bronx, southeast Queens, and much of Staten Island exhibit large clusters of low-frequency stops, particularly from bus routes with infrequent service. These areas are often geographically isolated from the subway network, requiring long wait times or multiple transfers to access other boroughs.</p>
      <p>No-transit-access zones further highlight disparities in transit coverage. In the Bay Area, large unserved zones appear in Contra Costa County, outer Alameda, southern Marin, and parts of the South Bay. While some of these areas are wealthier and car-oriented, others are adjacent to working-class communities with limited alternatives. In New York City, there are less notable access voids found, with the very few only found on the outskirts of the city. Although not always high-poverty zones, these areas may still represent vulnerable populations—such as the elderly, disabled, or transit-dependent, who face disproportionate burdens due to geographic exclusion. This spatial mismatch between need and service provision echoes prior findings from Jiao and Dillivan (2013) on transit deserts, and it calls into question how effectively federally funded transit investments are meeting their equity objectives.</p>
    
    <h2>Evaluation and Limitations</h2>
      <p>While the spatial analysis is rigorous and the visualizations are compelling, the study is not without limitations. The analysis is limited to weekday service and does not account for weekend, evening, or early morning schedules, times when low-income and shift workers may be most dependent on public transit. Additionally, while GTFS provides scheduled headways, it does not capture real-time performance or on-time reliability, which are crucial aspects of user experience. The no-access zones rely on fixed buffer distances, which may not reflect real pedestrian realities such as sidewalk quality, elevation, or safety. Furthermore, the project does not yet incorporate actual funding allocation data, which would be necessary to determine whether service inequities correspond to disparities in federal investment.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps and Opportunities</h2>
      <p>Despite these limitations, the dashboard offers a robust foundation for further investigation. A clear next step would be to integrate data from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the National Transit Database (NTD) to track how funding is allocated across agencies, routes, and neighborhoods. Adding demographic layers beyond income, such as race, and car ownership, would deepen the equity lens and better reflect the lived experiences of marginalized communities. Expanding the geographic scope to include other U.S. metropolitan areas, or examining changes over time using historic GTFS feeds, could support longitudinal analyses of whether transit access is improving or worsening. Finally, incorporating actual ridership data or mobile device-based travel flows could validate whether areas with poor service also suffer from underutilization or suppressed demand.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, this research makes a compelling case that public transit access, even in cities with expansive systems like New York and San Francisco, is far from equitable. The presence of a bus stop does not guarantee timely, reliable access to the urban fabric. Rather, true transit equity must account for service frequency, walkability, user demographics, and infrastructure funding. Tools like the Transit Inequity Dashboard not only make these disparities visible but also challenge planners and policymakers to close the service gaps that persist in America’s most transit-dependent cities. The road to equitable mobility is not just paved with new infrastructure, it requires targeted, data-driven investment in the communities that have been left waiting.</p>
