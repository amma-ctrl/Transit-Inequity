    <p>Visualizing public transit access gaps and demographic impacts</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This project investigates spatial inequities in public transit access across the Bay Area. Using data from the National Transit Database and U.S. Census, we created dashboards to visualize areas lacking reliable transit and explore how these gaps correlate with socioeconomic characteristics such as income, race, and vehicle ownership.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dashboard 1: No Transit Access Zones</h2>
      <p>This dashboard highlights areas that fall outside a ¼-mile walkable buffer of any public transit stop (bus or train). These zones represent "true transit deserts" — communities with no nearby transit infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>Dashboard 2: Low-Frequency Transit Areas</h2>
      <p>This dashboard displays areas where transit stops exist but service frequency is below a usable threshold (e.g., fewer than 3 trips per hour). These areas reveal the hidden inaccessibility masked by apparent coverage.</p>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        We used ArcGIS Pro to perform spatial analyses, including buffer analysis to find no-access zones and zonal statistics to compare service levels with demographic data. Transit stop and service data were obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and the National Transit Database. Demographics were sourced from the 2020 5-year ACS at the tract level. All data were projected into WGS 1984 Web Mercator (EPSG: 3857) for consistency.

    <section>
      <h2>Findings</h2>
      <p>
        We identified significant disparities in transit access across income levels. In particular, low-income communities in suburban zones such as Antioch, Vallejo, and East Contra Costa face both no access and low service frequency. Meanwhile, more affluent areas in Marin and the Peninsula show high access despite low population densities.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This analysis shows that formal transit coverage does not equal usable service. Many areas marked as "served" fall short due to low frequency, leaving residents functionally stranded. Addressing transit inequity requires not only expanding networks but improving service reliability in underinvested regions.
