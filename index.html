    <h2>Introduction & Research Design</h2>
    <p>
      Access to reliable public transportation is a foundational element of urban equity, shaping economic opportunity, social inclusion, and quality of life. This project explores whether federally funded public transit systems in two of the most transit-reliant cities in the U.S.—New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area—provide equitable service across income levels and geographies.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Research Questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do lower-income communities have comparable access to public transit infrastructure as wealthier communities?</li>
      <li>Where are the geographic “transit deserts” that lack even minimal access to federally funded transit services?</li>
      <li>How does the frequency of transit service vary across income levels?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Hypotheses:</strong> Low-income census tracts have less access to frequent transit service than wealthier tracts, and areas with no transit access are disproportionately located in low- to moderate-income zones.</p>
    <p>
      This research builds on findings by Manaugh & El-Geneidy (2012) and Karner & Niemeier (2013), who argue that frequency and reliability—beyond stop proximity—are critical indicators of transit equity.
    </p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>This study used ArcGIS Pro to prepare, analyze, and visualize transit and demographic data through a three-layer map structure embedded in a dashboard:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Transit Frequency:</strong> Using GTFS data, stops were flagged as “low-frequency” if they had average weekday headways of 20+ minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Low-Frequency Stop Counts:</strong> Total low-frequency stops per census tract were calculated using spatial join, then visualized as semi-transparent orange circles.</li>
      <li><strong>No Access Zones:</strong> Red diamonds mark zones more than 0.5 miles from any bus/train stop and 0.75 miles from any ferry stop—areas considered to have no practical access to transit.</li>
      <li><strong>Demographic Overlay:</strong> Census tracts were color-coded by median household income using a yellow-green-blue scale across 5 brackets:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>&lt; $50,000</li>
        <li>$50,000–$85,000</li>
        <li>$85,000–$125,000</li>
        <li>$125,000–$200,000</li>
        <li>&gt; $200,000</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <h3>Low-Frequency Stops</h3>
    <p>
      In both NYC and the Bay Area, low-frequency stops cluster in outer boroughs or suburban peripheries. Queens, Staten Island, North San Jose, and Alameda County show notable concentrations—particularly in tracts earning under $85,000. This pattern reinforces the idea that transit frequency is unequally distributed.
    </p>

    <h3>No Access Zones</h3>
    <p>
      These transit deserts—areas completely outside effective transit reach—appear most often in outlying geographies: Staten Island’s eastern edge, Contra Costa County, and areas bordering the Bronx River. While some overlap with lower-income tracts, others affect middle-income zones as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Demographic Insights</h3>
    <p>
      High-frequency transit and dense service areas tend to align with higher-income tracts. Conversely, moderate- to low-income areas are disproportionately impacted by infrequent or nonexistent service—highlighting a clear equity gap.

    <h2>Evaluation & Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      This project succeeds in making spatial transit inequities visible—layering frequency, access, and income to reveal service gaps that a simple coverage map might miss. However, several limitations should be noted:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only weekday service was analyzed; off-peak or weekend frequencies may differ significantly.</li>
      <li>GTFS headways were averaged, not weighted by ridership or time-of-day.</li>
      <li>Federal funding levels per route or agency were not included in this version.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Despite these, the dashboard provides a strong foundation for advocacy and deeper research into equitable transit funding and design.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorporate actual funding data for each agency and route.</li>
      <li>Add racial and car access data for sharper equity comparisons.</li>
      <li>Apply this framework to other metro areas or run a historical comparison.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The long-term goal is to develop a national-level toolkit for evaluating federally funded transit through an equity lens—balancing frequency, access, and demographics.
