    <h1>Transit Inequity in the San Francisco Bay Area</h1>
    <p>Visualizing access gaps and service disparities across income and geography</p>
  </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This project investigates transit access disparities across the Bay Area using spatial analysis and open data. Dashboards below show areas completely lacking access and zones with low-frequency transit service, visualized alongside demographic and income patterns.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dashboard 1: No Transit Access Zones</h2>
      <p>This dashboard identifies areas outside a ¼-mile walkable buffer from any bus or rail stop. These locations are true “transit deserts” — communities with no formal access to the regional transit network.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Dashboard 2: Low-Frequency Transit Areas</h2>
      <p>This dashboard highlights communities with transit stops, but with low service frequency — typically fewer than 3 trips per hour. These areas represent hidden inaccessibility, where transit exists but is not reliable enough for daily use.</p>
    </section>
  </div>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>Using ArcGIS Pro, we conducted overlay analysis to buffer transit stops, identify low-frequency services, and intersect results with demographic and income data from the 2020 ACS. Results were symbolized by severity and visualized in ArcGIS Dashboards.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Findings</h2>
      <p>Communities in East Bay (e.g., Richmond, Antioch, San Leandro) and outer suburban areas showed significant lack of access and low-frequency service. These areas also had higher proportions of lower-income households and communities of color, highlighting structural transit inequities.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Transit availability alone is not enough — frequency and walkable access are key to mobility equity. This work supports the need for regional investment in underserved neighborhoods and more transparent service planning tools.</p>
